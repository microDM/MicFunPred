CBM1	pfam00734	Previously known as cellulose-binding domain family I (CBD I). 	Modules of approx. 40 residues found almost exclusively in fungi. The cellulose-binding function has been demonstrated in many cases, and appears to be mediated by three aromatic residues separated by about 10.4 angstrom and which form a flat surface. The only non-fungal occurence of CBM1 is in an algal non-hydrolytic polysaccharide-binding protein which is composed of four repeated CBM1 modules. Binding to chitin has been demonstrated in one case.

These modules have since been found in a number of other proteins of various functions including glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. While in the plant lectins this module binds mannose, binding to xylan has been demonstrated in the Streptomyces lividans xylanase A and arabinofuranosidase B.

GT104	COG4394	Lassak et al. identified EarP as EF-P arginine R32 specific rhamnosyl transferase in Shewanella oneidensis using dTDP-b-L-rhamnose as donor substrate (PMID=25686373). The results of this study were subsequently confirmed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PMID=26060278), Pseudomonas putida (PMID=28951478) and Neisseria meningitidis (PMID=26840407). In 2016, it has been shown for S. oneidensis (PMID=28451135) and P. aeruginosa (PMID=28451332) that the enzyme is an inverting glycosyltransferase, thus mediating the formation of an a-L-rhamnosidic linkage. A structural basis for the arginine glycosylation reaction was provided by Krafczyk, Macosek and coworkers by having solved the crystal structure of the GT-B folding EarP from P. putida and an accompanying biochemical analysis of the enzyme (PMID=28951478).	dTDP-beta-L-Rhap : arginine alpha-L-rhamnosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.-)
